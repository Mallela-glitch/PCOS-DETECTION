PCOS Detection Using Ultrasound Images
This project develops a deep learning-based classifier to detect Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using ultrasound images. The solution is built with TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging VGG16 as the base model via transfer learning. Images are processed and normalized using OpenCV. The dataset is downloaded via Kaggle API.
Features:
VGG16-based image classifier
Transfer learning with custom top layers
Data preprocessing and augmentation
Handles Kaggle dataset download and extraction
Model evaluation with visualization
Project Goals:
- Build an AI model to detect PCOS from ultrasound images  
- Use VGG16 as the base model (transfer learning)  
- Train the model with high accuracy  
- Save the trained model  
- Create a simple inference script to predict new images  
- Upload project to GitHub for sharing
